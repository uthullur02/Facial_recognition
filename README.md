# Facial Recognition Application

This repository contains code for a facial recognition application utilizing the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Jupyter Notebook

If Jupyter Notebook is not installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

### 2. Download LFW Dataset

Download the LFW dataset from [here](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) and ensure it's accessible in your file system.

### 3. Upload Dataset to Notebook

Upload the downloaded LFW dataset to your Jupyter Notebook environment.

### 4. Folder Structure

Create the following folder structure in your repository:

- `application_data/`
  - `input_image/`: Store input images for facial recognition tasks.
  - `verification_image/`: Store images used for verification tasks.

- `data/`: Store data for training the facial recognition model.
  - `anchor/`: Store anchor images for triplet loss.
  - `positive/`: Store positive images for triplet loss.
  - `negative/`: Store negative images for triplet loss.

- `training_checkpoints/`: Store saved checkpoints of the trained model.

You can create these folders manually or run the provided code in a Jupyter Notebook to create them automatically.

### 5. Running the Facial Recognition Code

Execute the code provided in the Jupyter Notebook to perform facial recognition tasks. This code will utilize the LFW dataset and train a facial recognition model.
